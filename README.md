<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This demo video shows how to use the app: https://youtu.be/BqiydM8GXB8

Currently, the app is specialized to handle a specific prescription label format. Here are a few sample labels to test the functionality of our app: 
https://ibb.co/G7mSG0V

When typing in your phone number to create a reminder, it is necessary to specify the area code. For examnple, the phone number 2292001867 with a U.S. area code (+1) must be entered as +12292001867.

In order to stop receiving messages, text STOP to the reminder number. This information can also be accessed by texting an incorrect response to the number. The prescription images provided are for medication needed to be taken daily over a multiple day period - be wary of multiple texts if you do not text STOP.
